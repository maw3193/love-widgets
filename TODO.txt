TODO list and design doc
===

Purpose
---

This repo is for fiddling around with love2d to put together various gui elements to be used with other projects.
The ultimate driver is a vague idea of a top-down sandbox RPG with settlement management.

Todo items
---
* Probably simpler to have windows with an inner widgetcontainer.
  - **TURNS OUT NOT**, I have stencilling problems, I think
* An inventory
  - defines items, shows them in a list.
  - Need to be able to take a table, generate a list of widgets from that, and display those.
  - Must be able to handle having more items than the window can display.
* Should the last-interacted-with window be brought to the top?
* Text boxes/text input?
* Passing keyboard input to windows?
* Once you've pressed inside a widgetcontainer, clamp the cursor until you release
  - BUT NOT FOR RESIZE BUTTON
