TODO list and design doc
===

Purpose
---

This repo is for fiddling around with love2d to put together various gui elements to be used with other projects.

Todo items
---
* Stop widgetcontainers from overspilling outside their extent with stencils
  - It works, somewhat
  - Dunno how well non-stencil widgetcontainers work.
  - **BUT, I can't use the resize button with my stencils currently**
* Once you've pressed inside a widgetcontainer, clamp the cursor until you release
  - BUT NOT FOR RESIZE BUTTON
* Should the last-interacted-with window be brought to the top?
* Text boxes/text input?
* Passing keyboard input to windows?
